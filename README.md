  ## Installation
  This project uses the following dependencies: dotenv, Express, Sequelize. Please install these before proceeding.

  ## Usage
  In order to use this ecommerce tool, first type "npm run seed" in the command line. Then, after typing "npm start", open Insomnia or Postman to see the data. You can get information for categories, products, and tags, or a specific item in any of these three groups. You can also add to, update, or delete any existing data.
